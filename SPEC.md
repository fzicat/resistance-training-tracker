# RTT - Resistance Training Tracker

A simple, mobile-first web app to log exercises set-by-set. Built for quick data entry at the gym with easy recall of recent performance.

---

## Core Purpose

> **Primary goal**: Help me remember what weight I used last week for each exercise.

- Log each **set** individually (not grouping sets together)
- Quick lookup of recent history per exercise
- Simple and fast—no coaching, planning, or analytics clutter

---

## Data Model

Build a script to create tables on Supabase.

### Exercises
| Column       | Type    | Notes                                      |
|--------------|---------|-------------------------------------------|
| id           | integer | auto, pk                                   |
| name         | text    | case-insensitive unique constraint         |
| metrics      | jsonb   | e.g. `{"weight": true, "reps": true, "time": false, "distance": false}` |
| is_deleted   | bool    | soft delete (default: false)               |
| created_at   | timestamp | auto                                     |

> **Note**: Using JSONB for metrics allows future extensibility (e.g., adding "tempo", "band_resistance") without schema migrations.

## Development Guidelines

Use the following skills during implementation:

- **frontend-design**: For creating distinctive, production-grade UI with high design quality. Apply to all components, pages, and styling work.
- **vercel-react-best-practices**: For React and Next.js performance optimization. Apply when writing components, data fetching, and bundle optimization.

---

## Authentication

- **Single user** app (no multi-user support needed)
- **Persistent session**: 1 day expiry
- **Online required**: No offline support
  - Show error toast if no connection; user retries manually

---

## UI/UX Guidelines

### Core Principles

- **Mobile-first**: Designed for phone use at the gym
- **Large tap targets**: Easy to hit with sweaty fingers
- **Minimal taps**: Log a set in < 5 taps
- **No clutter**: Only show what's needed for logging
- **Keep it simple**: Avoid overengineering

### Input Controls

- All metrics use **number inputs** (no steppers, no custom pickers)
- Native browser date picker for Repeat a Day

### Feedback

- **Success toast**: "Set saved! 💪" after logging
- **Error toast**: With retry button on failures

### Empty States

- Today's Workout: "No Exercises"
- Exercise History: "No history yet"
- Exercise Library: "Create your first exercise"

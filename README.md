# RTT — Resistance Training Tracker

A mobile-first web app for logging resistance training sets at the gym. Built around one core need: **remembering what weight you used last time**.

No coaching, no analytics dashboards, no social features — just fast set logging with automatic recall of your last performance.

## Features

- **Today's Workout** — View scheduled exercises, tap to log sets, or add exercises on the fly
- **Set Logging** — Weight, reps, time, distance, and RIR (Reps In Reserve) inputs with auto-prefill from your last logged set
- **Exercise Library** — Create and manage exercises with configurable metrics (weight, reps, time, distance, unilateral, dual implements)
- **Scheduled Workouts** — Plan workouts for any date, reorder exercises via drag-and-drop, copy workouts between dates
- **Repeat a Day** — Copy a previous day's exercises into today's workout with auto-generated set summaries
- **Rest Timer** — Floating stopwatch for timing rest between sets
- **Swipe-to-Delete** — Swipe set history rows to soft-delete
- **Dark/Light Theme** — Gruvbox color palette with toggle in settings
- **PWA Support** — Installable as a standalone app with service worker and manifest

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- A [Supabase](https://supabase.com) project

### 1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fzicat/resistance-training-tracker.git
cd resistance-training-tracker
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Set up Supabase

Create a new Supabase project and run the schema migration in the SQL Editor:

```bash
# The schema file is at:
supabase/schema.sql
```

This creates the `exercises`, `sets`, `workouts`, and `workouts_exercises` tables with Row Level Security policies for authenticated users.

### 4. Configure environment variables

Create a `.env.local` file:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
```

### 5. Run the dev server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) — sign up with email/password to get started.

## Data Model

Four tables power the app:

- **exercises** — Name, configurable metric flags (weight/reps/time/distance/unilateral/dual), soft delete
- **sets** — Individual logged sets with nullable metrics and RIR, linked to an exercise
- **workouts** — A date (unique) representing a workout day
- **workouts_exercises** — Junction table linking workouts to exercises with sort order and freeform details text

## Scripts

| Command         | Description              |
|-----------------|--------------------------|
| `npm run dev`   | Start dev server         |
| `npm run build` | Production build         |
| `npm run start` | Start production server  |
| `npm run lint`  | Run ESLint               |
